## What is this library used for?

C++ standard library does not include a ready to use Event Handling mechanism. This library is designed to work as a 
singleton throughout the application and to communicate thread-safely between different code blocks via the required 
events with its generic structure.

With the Event Hub library, you can add or remove new listeners to the events, as you are used to in other languages, 
listen to a single event or all events from one place and emit them with the required type of data.


## How to add it to my project?

This is a header only library with no external dependency. So actually, all you need is to add the libcpp-event-hub.hpp file
in src folder to your project and start using it with #include.

You can find usage examples in the examples folder, also find a sample CMakeLists.txt file content below.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)

project(myProject)

add_executable(myProject main.cpp)

target_link_libraries(myProject PRIVATE libcpp-event-hub)

```

## How to use?

You can find a simple example of adding & deleting event listeners and emitting events to handle different types of them below.

```cpp
#include "libcpp-event-hub.hpp"
#include <string>
#include <iostream>

using namespace lklibs;

int main()
{
    // Get the singleton instance of the EventHub
    auto& eventHub = EventHub::getInstance();

    // Add a listener for testEvent1, which sends a string value
    auto listener1Id = eventHub.addListener<std::string>("testEvent1", [](const std::string& eventName, const std::string& sender, const std::string& data)
    {
        std::cout << "1. listener received, Event name: " << eventName << ", sender: " << sender << ", data: " << data << std::endl;
    });

    // Add a listener for testEvent2, which sends an int value
    auto listener2Id = eventHub.addListener<int>("testEvent2", [](const std::string& eventName, const std::string& sender, const int& data)
    {
        std::cout << "2 listener received, Event name: " << eventName << ", sender: " << sender << ", data: " << data << std::endl;
    });

    // Add a general listener for all events with a string value
    auto listener3Id = eventHub.addListener<std::string>("*", [](const std::string& eventName, const std::string& sender, const std::string& data)
    {
        std::cout << "General listener received: " << eventName << ", sender: " << sender << ", data: " << data << std::endl;
    });

    // Emit testEvent1 with a string value, 2 listeners will receive the event (listener1 and the general listener)
    eventHub.emit("testEvent1", "main", std::string("Value 1"));

    // Emit testEvent2 with an int value, 1 listeners will receive the event (listener2), because there is no general listener for int values
    eventHub.emit("testEvent2", "main", 7);

    // Remove the first listener for testEvent1
    eventHub.removeListener("testEvent1", listener1Id);

    // Emit testEvent1 again, only the general listener will receive the event
    eventHub.emit("testEvent1", "main", std::string("Value 2"));

    return 0;
}
```

## Semantic Versioning

Versioning of the library is done using conventional semantic versioning. Accordingly,
in the versioning made as **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**;

**PATCH:** Includes possible Bug&Fixes and improvements. You definitely want to get this.

**MINOR:** Additional functionality added via backwards compatibility. You probably want to
get this, it doesn't hurt.

**MAJOR:** Additional functionality that breaks backwards compatibility. You'll need to know
what's changed before you get it, and you'll probably have to make changes to your own code.
If I publish something like this, I will definitely add the changes required for migration
section to the documentation.
